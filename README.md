# URLImageDemo

This app demonstrates how to use [URLImage](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/url-image) package with different SwiftUI view. It also serves as testing and performance benchmark.

Current examples:
- `List`
- `LazyVStack`
- `LazyVGrid`

If you have an example of UI using `URLImage` in mind, but you don't know how to implement it, open an issue and if I have time I will implement it.
